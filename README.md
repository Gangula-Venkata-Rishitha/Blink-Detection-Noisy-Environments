# Blink-Detection-Noisy-Environments
Blink-Based Cognitive Load Detection under Controlled and Noisy Environments — A 2-week research project using existing datasets (RT-BENE, HUST-LEBW, NTHU-DDD) to evaluate how extended rest baselines improve the stability and robustness of blink features in illumination- and occlusion-rich conditions.
